# Methodology
Start this as a streamlit file.
So what files do you need open?

* sample other file

Purpose:
To provide a size of building and size of land required estimate, with cost estimate with effect to rentals

So output
a - line graph - rooms included in remodel of building X axis Y axis the additional revenue
b - land requirement - number of rooms in building.

# Sections

Carolines Appointment App:
Purpose to be go to location to visually see the impact of corona on appointment types
line graph of appointment count per type by CCG.
Select CCG and grouped bar chart by practice: telephone/face to face/nurse etc
Map where practices size of marker circle by ratio of increase to non face to face.





What need to know:
Has the site 
Have you got enough land for what want to do on this site?


## Existing site Summary table
Table 
site size:
Building footprint:
Remaining site area m2:
Car parking spaces:
Building GIA:
% of building patient facing:
Tenants:
Clinical rooms:
Car parking requirement based on existing rooms:
Additional clinical rooms to existing car parking = 
How many more car parking spaces could you get on site (from looking at google)
How many more clinical rooms are permitted for these spaces.

Car parking requirement
How many clinical rooms require?
Spaces required?






## Size of building

This feels like a lot of inputs.
Also you lose all your inputs after you leave it.
So when finished you need table of inputs etc that you can export.
Then you can re-run in future.
Feels like a lot of work for person to infill in advance
Better in a CSV import?
But then you cannot adjust and play with in the app to try different options.
What if this what if that?
Also would be nice to do for several sites at once.
Something about allowing for collection of outputs when testing.

So is this a calculator tool or an options tool.
The options tool is better as it optimises the options.
Think below is an excellent first step.

A - Is there another way round this. What about what a site can really fit on it?
So you put the site size in and it tells you the clinical capacity of site.
So what as a m2 then you can split this area into mix of room.
No I think your method below is the better version.

The 3PD tells you the site size you need. So can reverse it or see what can fit into the size you have.

Issy is right you need to know what a building KPI you should have. % admin % circulation % clinical
So you need to build the app up to work out the optimum schedule of accommodation for clinical rooms.
This then feeds all the other stuff.
So build up a schedule of accommodation.
So say a tab for each user with inputs.
Then it works out the non shared space for this.
Then works out the shared space for collective - waiting etc.
each calculation
You definitely need to do this. A more explicit sizing app
Would be good to score all the buildings for efficiency - cost/m2


Try and make this so logical progression:

## How many clinical rooms can the site be increased by?
Current site size:
Current building footprint:
Area of site - landscaping and car park = m2 %
Current clinical room count (by room type)
Number of spaces required:
Number of current spaces:
Balance (should be enough or more than required) if < then state that building capacity cannot be increased.

Car parking increase = X

** where up to!**
So it is a balance between how many spaces and how much extension.
So like 1 room = Xm2 equivalent of car parking + Xm2 of building
Which then you can see if the land has this level of space remaining on site?
Like this = m2 per clinical room + Xm2 car parking


Increase in clinical rooms = (Calc)
What m2 would this require? =

## Can the existing premise be remodelled to get more clinical rooms?
GIA =
Clinical Area = x% if < 30% then yes to answer.
Additional clinical rooms in footprint =
Balance of rooms that could go on site in extension = XXX

## Is there enough room for extension?
Area of additional car parking - m2
Balance of site area - m2



6.0 Estimated additional clinical rooms in existing building if remodelled within existing footprint = TypeA/B/C
 (Judgement based on visits etc)
   Calculated output = m2 required for the rooms including support space for remodel. ie what need to find in footprint
   Calculated output = m2 of extension from rooms remaining after remodel
7.0 Existing backlog maintenance = (will have to be considered in cost)
8.0 extension storeys = X => increase to site footprint.


OUTPUTS:
1.0 Estimated increase size of GIA = + XXXm2
2.0 Existing Plot size sufficient = +/- m2 (clinical rooms:car parkingm2 + extensionm2) - existing plot size

3.0 Graph Construction rate / Capital cost : x = construction rate (1k-3k) y = development capital cost
4.0 Graph Construction rate / revenue increase : x = construction rate y = revenue increase per year (rental increase + increased running cost)

Will think bit more as build to extend the above. But appreciate comments for what you need in your reports from this.
